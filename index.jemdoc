== Welcome

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering at University of Southern California, affiliated with the
[https://wides.usc.edu/
Wireless Devices and Systems (WiDeS) Group], under the supervision of Professor
[https://wides.usc.edu/founder.html
Andreas F. Molisch].
Prior to that, I received my M.S. and B.E. degrees from the
[https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/
Department of Electronic Engineering],
[https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/
Tsinghua University] in 2018 and 2015, respectively. My advisor was Professor
[http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~shenyuan/
Yuan Shen].

~~~
My research interests include stochastic network control and optimization, especially in the integration of computing, caching, and communication (3C) technologies into next-generation network design. I am currently working on modeling, analysis, evaluation, and control of next-generation computing networks (e.g., distributed cloud, mobile edge, and fog computing) and services (e.g., autonomous driving, AR\/MR\/\VR\/XR, and industrial automation).
